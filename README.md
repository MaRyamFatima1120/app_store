# 🛍️ App Store – Flutter E-Commerce App

A modern and responsive **E-Commerce mobile application** built with **Flutter** and **GetX**.  
This app allows users to browse products, explore categories, view product details, add favorites, and manage their account—all with a clean UI and smooth navigation.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This app was developed as a **trial project** when applying for a Flutter developer position.  
It demonstrates my ability to work with **GetX state management**, create **responsive UIs**, implement **dynamic data flow**, and deliver a fully functional app within professional standards.
